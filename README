This is not the greatest prog in the world, this is just a tribute.

Bringing back the old days. Things like this is exactly what got me into programming.

This is a work in progress and has only been tested on AOL 9.7.

Install Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition here: http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9863608

Request a spotify developer key here, it's instant: https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/
Save the binary key to ~/qwik.spotify/spotify_appkey.key

Choose a playlist with `pl <playlist name>` and `plr` to randomly play a song from the selected playlist.

Come hang out in pr vb.
